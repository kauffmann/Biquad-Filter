Audio Plugin Template


Want to create an audio plugin (e.g., a VST3 plugin) with C++ but don't know how to go about?


* clear repo structure
* C++ 23 standard
* effortless handling of third-party dependencies with the CPM package manager; use the C++ libraries you want together with JUCE
* highest warning level and "treat warnings as errors"
* ready-to-go unit test project with GoogleTest

Additionally

* continuous integration made easy with Github actions: build and run tests on the main branch and on every pull request
* automatic clang-format on C++ files run on every commit; don't worry about code formatting anymore!


## Usage

This is a template repository which means you can right click "Use this template" on GitHub and create your own repo out of it.

After cloning it locally, you can proceed with the usual CMake workflow.

In the main repo directory execute

```bash
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build
```

The first run will take the most time because the dependencies (CPM, JUCE, and googletest) need to be downloaded.

Alternatively, you can use bundled CMake presets:

```bash
$ cmake --preset default # uses the Ninja build system
$ cmake --build build
$ ctest --preset default
```

Existing presets are `default`, `release`, and `Xcode`.

To run clang-format on every commit, in the main directory execute

```bash
pre-commit install
```

(for this you may need to install `pre-commit` with `pip`: `pip install pre-commit`).
